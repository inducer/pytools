Type Variables Used
-------------------

.. class:: _SupportsLT

    A :class:`~typing.Protocol` for `__lt__` support.

.. class:: NodeT

    Type of a graph node, can be any hashable type.

.. class:: GraphT

    A :class:`collections.abc.Mapping` representing a directed
    graph. The mapping contains one key representing each node in the
    graph, and this key maps to a :class:`collections.abc.Collection` of its
    successor nodes. Note that most functions expect that every graph node
    is included as a key in the graph.
